# cl-clj
Prague Lambda talk about common lisp basics for clojure programers

## This was presented with tmux:
* one pane `vim`, after opening run `:source vimscript`
* one pane `lein repl`, later close this pane
* one or more panes `rlwrap sbcl`, `rlwrap ccl`, `rlwrap abcl`, ... any common
  lisp, for some sections (disassamble etc.) mostly sbcl
